# DevPulse — Chrome Web Store Listing

## Name

DevPulse — Performance HUD for Developers

## Short Description (132 chars max)

Real-time performance overlay for web developers. Monitor FPS, DOM nodes, memory, CLS, and Core Web Vitals — right on the page.

## Detailed Description (max ~10,000 chars)

DevPulse gives you a real-time performance heads-up display that floats directly on any web page you're working on. Click the toolbar icon to toggle the HUD — no DevTools needed.

PRO METRICS ($2.99 lifetime)

DEVELOPER-FRIENDLY
• Shadow DOM isolation — won't break your app's styles or React/Vue/Next.js
• Draggable, collapsible HUD with position memory
• Dark and light theme with system preference support
• Localhost persistence — HUD auto-restores after page refresh on localhost
• Minimal permissions — activeTab + scripting only, no <all_urls>
• Zero runtime dependencies — all metrics use native browser APIs

HOW IT WORKS

1. Click the DevPulse icon in your toolbar
2. The performance HUD appears on the current page

4. Click the X to dismiss, or click the icon again

PRIVACY
